(You must build vivoh-media-relay first, and then copy the .exe file into here)

To Install NSIS (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)
Documentation for NSIS (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Docs/)

To update installer, change Install Script.nsi:

  NSIS requires install script and all files to be installed in the same folder.
  To update file(s) like the license or Vivoh version, update file(s) in the same folder containing the install script.
  Make sure the names of new file(s) to be installed matches the names of files to be installed in the script (Install Script, line 29 and below)
  Open NSIS and run updated Install Script.nsi. This will create a new windows installer in the folder containing the install script. This will create a Windows installer that will install all the files, it will automatically be added to the folder containing the new updated script, if it  runs correctly.
